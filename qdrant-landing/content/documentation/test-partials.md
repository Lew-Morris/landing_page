This is a POC of features that we already have, and possibly others from Hugo
(gohugo.io) that I'd like to incorporate into our docs. We should also be able
to use this in our articles and blog posts.

This feature relates to progressive disclosure. When we have a "lot" of content, 
many readers may want to skip over content such as descriptions of HNSW that they
already know. (Tip, click on the right facing arrow.)

<!-- commenting out related Hugo feature -->
<!-- {{  expand "More info on HNSW" }} -->
<! -- Once we have a canonical Qdrant definition for HNSW, we can add it here. -->
<!-- {{ /expand }} -->
