# Advanced RAG with RAPTOR

Working with non-standard text such as code documentation, or non-English text, can be challenging. The Recursive Abstractive Processing for Tree-Organized Retrieval (RAPTOR) methodology offers a novel approach to organizing and retrieving information from such text. In this tutorial, we will implement RAPTOR with Langchain to create a powerful information retrieval system for code documentation.

Here, we use OpenAI LLM and Embedding both -- but if you cannot send data to an external service, you can use [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) to run  our own LLM model on our premises, using [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/en/) as a cloud provider. Qdrant, acting in this setup as a knowledge base providing the relevant pieces of documents for a given query, will also be hosted in the Hybrid Cloud mode on Scaleway. The last missing piece, the Langchain application will be also running in the same environment.

# RAPTOR: Recursive Abstractive Processing for Tree-Organized Retrieval

The RAPTOR methodology introduces a novel approach to document indexing and retrieval. It organizes documents or text chunks into a hierarchical structure that mimics a tree. Starting with the initial documents, referred to as `leafs`, the process involves embedding these documents and clustering them based on similarities. 
These clusters are then abstracted into higher-level summaries, encapsulating the essence of the documents within each cluster. This recursive abstraction continues, moving from the concrete details found in the `leafs` to increasingly abstract summaries at higher levels of the tree.

![RAPTOR Outline](/documentation/tutorials/raptor-langchain/outline.png)

The implementation of RAPTOR discussed here is based on the [Langchain Cookbook](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/cookbook/RAPTOR.ipynb), which provides practical examples and code for applying this approach to real-world data.

```python
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Tuple

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tiktoken
import umap
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as Soup
from langchain import hub
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_community.document_loaders.recursive_url_loader import RecursiveUrlLoader
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Qdrant
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI, OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture
```

### Tokenization of Documentation Texts

This section demonstrates the process of tokenizing documentation texts from two sources: Qdrant's Quick Start guide and Langchain's documentation on Qdrant integrations. The `num_tokens_from_string` function is used to calculate the number of tokens in each document, utilizing a specific encoding (`cl100k_base`). The documents are fetched using a `RecursiveUrlLoader`, which retrieves the text content from the specified URLs. After combining and tokenizing the texts from both sources, the distribution of token counts is visualized through a histogram.

```python
def num_tokens_from_string(string: str, encoding_name: str) -> int:
    """Returns the number of tokens in a text string."""
    encoding = tiktoken.get_encoding(encoding_name)
    num_tokens = len(encoding.encode(string))
    return num_tokens


# QuickStart docs
url = "https://qdrant.tech/documentation/quick-start/"
loader = RecursiveUrlLoader(
    url=url, max_depth=20, extractor=lambda x: Soup(x, "html.parser").text
)
docs = loader.load()

## Langchain docs
url = "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/qdrant/"
loader = RecursiveUrlLoader(
    url=url, max_depth=20, extractor=lambda x: Soup(x, "html.parser").text
)
docs_langchain = loader.load()

# Doc texts
docs = docs + docs_langchain
docs_texts = [d.page_content for d in docs]

# Calculate the number of tokens for each document
counts = [num_tokens_from_string(d, "cl100k_base") for d in docs_texts]

# Plotting the histogram of token counts
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(counts, bins=30, color="blue", edgecolor="black", alpha=0.7)
plt.title("Histogram of Token Counts")
plt.xlabel("Token Count")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.grid(axis="y", alpha=0.75)

# Display the histogram
plt.show
```


Next, documents are first sorted based on their metadata source and then reversed. The content from these documents is concatenated into a single string, with triple newlines and a separator `---` between each document's content. The total number of tokens in the concatenated content is calculated using the OpenAI tokenizer (`cl100k_base`). The output indicates that the concatenated content comprises 8054 tokens, demonstrating the process of preparing and analyzing text data for further processing or analysis.

```python
# Doc texts concat
d_sorted = sorted(docs, key=lambda x: x.metadata["source"])
d_reversed = list(reversed(d_sorted))
concatenated_content = "\n\n\n --- \n\n\n".join(
    [doc.page_content for doc in d_reversed]
)
print(
    "Num tokens in all context: %s"
    % num_tokens_from_string(concatenated_content, "cl100k_base")
)
```

### Doc texts split

In this section, the process of splitting a large text document into smaller chunks is demonstrated. The `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` class from a text processing library is utilized, configured with a `chunk_size` of 2000 tokens and `chunk_overlap` of 0. This configuration means that the text will be divided into segments each containing up to 2000 tokens without any overlap between consecutive chunks. The `split_text` method is then called on a variable `concatenated_content`, which presumably contains the text to be split. This operation is essential for handling large texts that need to be processed in smaller, more manageable pieces, especially in contexts where processing limitations or performance considerations are a concern.

```python
# Doc texts split

chunk_size_tok = 2000
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder(
    chunk_size=chunk_size_tok, chunk_overlap=0
)
texts_split = text_splitter.split_text(concatenated_content)
```

## Models

```python
embd = OpenAIEmbeddings()
model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-4-1106-preview")
```

It is here that we configure both the Embeddings and LLM. You can replace this with your own models using Ollama or other services. Scaleway has some great [GPU Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/gpu-instances/) too - including H100 on the higher end, and soon L4 for everything small.

## Tree Construction

The clustering approach in tree construction includes a few interesting ideas.

**GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model)** 

- Model the distribution of data points across different clusters
- Optimal number of clusters by evaluating the model's Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)

**UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)** 

- Supports clustering
- Reduces the dimensionality of high-dimensional data
- UMAP helps to highlight the natural grouping of data points based on their similarities

**Local and Global Clustering** 

- Used to analyze data at different scales
- Both fine-grained and broader patterns within the data are captured effectively

**Thresholding** 

- Apply in the context of GMM to determine cluster membership
- Based on the probability distribution (assignment of data points to â‰¥ 1 cluster)

Code for GMM and thresholding is from Sarthi et al, as noted in the below two sources:
 
* [Origional repo](https://github.com/parthsarthi03/raptor/blob/master/raptor/cluster_tree_builder.py)
* [Minor tweaks](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/main/llama-index-packs/llama-index-packs-raptor/llama_index/packs/raptor/clustering.py)

### Collapsed Tree Retrieval for Enhanced Performance

The concept of `collapsed tree retrieval` is highlighted as a superior method for information retrieval, according to the paper. This method simplifies the search process by converting a hierarchical tree structure into a single layer, facilitating a more efficient k-nearest neighbors (kNN) search across all nodes. Instead of employing a traditional brute-force approach for kNN, the example utilizes Qdrant Vector Store, known for its rapid retrieval capabilities. The process involves building a tree from document texts (`leaf_texts`), then recursively embedding, clustering, and summarizing these texts across three levels.

```python
# Build tree
leaf_texts = docs_texts
results = recursive_embed_cluster_summarize(leaf_texts, level=1, n_levels=3)
```

### Using the Flattened, Indexed Tree in a RAG Chain

The process involves initializing a collection named `all_texts` with the content from `leaf_texts`. This collection is then expanded by iterating through the results obtained from a hierarchical structure, where summaries from each level are extracted and appended to `all_texts`. These summaries represent condensed information at various levels of the hierarchy, providing a comprehensive dataset that includes both detailed leaf-level texts and their higher-level summaries.

Subsequently, this enriched dataset is used to build a vector store using Qdrant, a powerful vector search engine. The `from_texts` method is employed to transform the texts into vectors using an embedding model referred to as `embd`, and these vectors are stored in-memory for efficient retrieval. The collection is named "lcel", indicating a specific use case or dataset.

Finally, a retriever is created from the vector store, enabling efficient search and retrieval of information based on vector similarity. This setup is particularly useful in applications requiring quick access to relevant information from a large, hierarchically structured dataset, such as document summarization, information retrieval, and question-answering systems.

```python
# Initialize all_texts with leaf_texts
all_texts = leaf_texts.copy()

# Iterate through the results to extract summaries from each level and add them to all_texts
for level in sorted(results.keys()):
    # Extract summaries from the current level's DataFrame
    summaries = results[level][1]["summaries"].tolist()
    # Extend all_texts with the summaries from the current level
    all_texts.extend(summaries)

# Now, use all_texts to build the vectorstore with Chroma
vectorstore = Qdrant.from_texts(all_texts, embd, location=":memory:", collection_name="lcel")
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()
```

## Trying it out

prompt = hub.pull("rlm/rag-prompt")

    return "\n\n".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs)
